## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!

Users should be able to:

-    View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
